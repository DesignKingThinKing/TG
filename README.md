### Steps on Telegram app: 

#### 1. First, open your Telegram app, and tap on search button, type `@BotFather`.

#### 2. Send a `/newbot` command message and:
  - Enter your the name of your Chatbot
  - Enter your Username:
        * E.g: `WatsonChat<anyOtherNames>Bot` (Replace `<anyOtherNames>` with whatever you would like to)
        
#### 3. Once created, the `@BotFather` will give you an `TOKEN`, *save it*

#### 1. Clone the repository or download it
  
#### 2. Rename the env.example for `.env`, add your `TOKEN` & Watson Assistant credentials.

#### 3. Run the command `npm install --save` and the required packages will be installed: 
   - dotenv
   - express
   - ibm-watson
   - node-telegram-bot-api
   - eslint

   - `Use localhost:8080 on the browser to check if the server is working`
   
#### 5. Time of testing your bot!
